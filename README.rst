This repository contains FIREWHEEL model components for using `VyOS <https://vyos.io>`_ routers within a FIREWHEEL experiment.

Building Images
===============

Due to licensing limitations, we are currently unable to provide the expected binary files (VM Resources nor Images) that are used within these model components.
For the VM Resources, we have provided an `INSTALL <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/tutorials/install_file.html>`__ script to reproducibly recreate them, when possible.
However, for images, users will need to follow the `Image Creation Tutorial <https://sandialabs.github.io/firewheel/tutorials/image.html>`__ to create compatible images.
The following images are referenced within this repository:
